    <h1>The Perfect Burger</h1>
    <img src="../images/perfect-burger.webp" alt="Photo of a bisected burger">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here are the ingredients & the instructions to make the perfect burger! Although it may not be the healthiest, use medium ground beef for moistness & flavour. The leaner varieties produce burgers that are drier with a denser, tighter texture. Don't use previously frozen meat as juices are lost during defrosting.</p>
    <p>If making ahead, cover with plastic wrap & refrigerate for no more than a day. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 lb medium ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly oil grill & heat BBQ to medium.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients.</li>
        <li>Crumble in beef & using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.</li>
        <li>Handle the meat as little as possible. The more you work it, the tougher it gets.</li>
        <li>Gently shape (don't firmly press) mixture into burgers about Â¾ inch thick.</li>
        <li>Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6-8 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>An instant read thermometer should read 160F.</li>
        <li>Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!</li>
        <li>Tuck into a warm crusty bun & add your favourite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
